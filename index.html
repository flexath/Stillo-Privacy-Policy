        <h1>Privacy Policy for Stillo</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

            information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 App Usage Data</h3>
        <p>

            <li>Frequency of app usage</li>
            <li>Features you interact with</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data helps us improve the app's functionality and user experience. All usage data is anonymized and 
            cannot be used to identify you personally.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 App Performance Data</h3>
        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Crash logs and error reports</li>
            <li>Performance metrics (app responsiveness, loading times)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is collected automatically and helps us identify and resolve technical issues.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Device Information</h3>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Analytics Data</h3>
        <p>
            We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics. This service helps us understand 
            how users interact with Stillo, which features are most popular, and how we can improve the app. 
            All analytics data is aggregated and anonymized.
        </p>

        <p>
            Stillo does <strong>not</strong> collect the following types of information:

        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not require account creation or registration to use Stillo. If you choose to use OAuth login 
            (e.g., Google Sign-In), authentication is handled by the third-party provider, and we do not store 
            your login credentials.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>

            <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> To understand how users interact with Stillo and enhance features</li>
            <li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> To identify, diagnose, and resolve technical issues and crashes</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> To ensure the app runs efficiently on different devices</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> To provide a better, more personalized experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Google Firebase</h3>
        <p>
            Stillo uses Google Firebase services, which may collect and process information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous usage statistics to help us understand app usage patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Collects crash reports and error logs to help us fix bugs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These services are provided by Google LLC and are subject to Google's Privacy Policy. You can learn more 
            about how Google uses data at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firebase data is stored on Google's servers and is subject to Google's data security measures. We do not 
            have direct access to personally identifiable information through these services.
        </p>

        <h2>5. App Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            Stillo may request the following permissions on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications (Optional):</strong> To send you reminders and alerts about your focus sessions. 
                You can disable this permission at any time in your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> To keep the focus timer running in the background when you switch 
                to other apps. This is essential for the app's core functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Wake Lock:</strong> To keep your device screen active during focus sessions, preventing the 
                screen from turning off while you're using the timer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All permissions are requested only when necessary for Stillo's functionality. You can revoke permissions 
            at any time through your device settings, though this may affect certain features.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Stillo stores data locally on your device. We do not store personal data on our servers. All focus session 
            data and app preferences are stored securely on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect. However, no method of 
            transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially 
            acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Stillo is not intended for children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information
            from children under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with
            personal information, please contact us immediately, and we will delete such information from our records.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 18 without verification
            of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>
            You have the following rights regarding your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stop Data Collection:</strong> You can stop all data collection by uninstalling Stillo from 
                your device. Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>Disable Analytics:</strong> You can opt out of Firebase Analytics by adjusting your device's 
                advertising settings or by uninstalling the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Permissions:</strong> You can manage app permissions at any time through your device's 
                settings menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect personally identifiable information and do not require account creation, there is 
            no account to delete or personal data to request removal of.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain anonymous analytics and crash data for as long as necessary to improve the app and fix issues. 
            This data is automatically deleted after a reasonable period or when it is no longer needed for these purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data stored locally on your device (such as focus session history) remains on your device until you 
            uninstall the app or clear the app's data.
        </p>
